# Python Functions

A comprehensive, hands-on curriculum designed to teach Python functions, object-oriented programming, and software design patterns through practical implementation exercises.

## Learning Path

This curriculum is structured as 5 progressive lessons, each building upon the previous concepts:

### Lesson Structure

Each lesson directory contains:
- **`lesson.py`** - Complete lesson with examples and explanations
- **`practice.py`** - Student exercises with TODO sections and hints

### Lesson Overview

| Lesson | Topic | Focus | Duration |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|
| [Lesson 1](lesson_1_functions/) | Functions Fundamentals | Reusable functions, type hints, error handling | 30-45 min |


### For Students
1. **Read the Lesson**: Start with `lesson.py` to understand concepts
2. **Practice Implementation**: Complete exercises in `practice.py`

### For Instructors
1. **Review Lesson Content**: Each `lesson.py` contains complete examples
2. **Assign Practice**: Students work through `practice.py` exercises

## Testing Your Code

```bash
# Run practice exercises
python lesson_1_functions/practice.py
```

## Learning Objectives
