# Python Functions & OOP Curriculum for Cursor IDE

A comprehensive, hands-on curriculum designed to teach Python functions, object-oriented programming, and software design patterns through practical implementation exercises.

## 🎯 Learning Path

This curriculum is structured as 5 progressive lessons, each building upon the previous concepts:

### 📚 Lesson Structure

Each lesson directory contains:
- **`lesson.py`** - Complete lesson with examples and explanations
- **`practice.py`** - Student exercises with TODO sections and hints

### 🚀 Lesson Overview

| Lesson | Topic | Focus | Duration |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|
| [Lesson 1](lesson_1_functions/) | Functions Fundamentals | Reusable functions, type hints, error handling | 30-45 min |
| [Lesson 2](lesson_2_classes/) | Classes and Objects | OOP basics, encapsulation, properties | 30-45 min |
| [Lesson 3](lesson_3_inheritance/) | Inheritance Patterns | Code reuse, polymorphism, abstract classes | 30-45 min |
| [Lesson 4](lesson_4_oop_principles/) | OOP Design Principles | SOLID principles, refactoring, design patterns | 30-45 min |

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

## 📋 Learning Objectives

### Functions Fundamentals
- ✅ Design reusable functions with proper parameter handling
- ✅ Use type hints and docstrings for self-documenting code
- ✅ Implement error handling and input validation
- ✅ Understand different return patterns and function composition

### Classes and Objects
- ✅ Design and implement complete classes with proper initialization
- ✅ Create methods that modify object state and return meaningful results
- ✅ Use properties and data validation to ensure object integrity
- ✅ Implement string representation methods for debugging and display

### Inheritance Patterns
- ✅ Design inheritance hierarchies with base and derived classes
- ✅ Implement method overriding and use super() for parent calls
- ✅ Create abstract base classes using the abc module
- ✅ Understand composition vs inheritance decision-making

### OOP Design Principles
- ✅ Apply SOLID principles to design clean, maintainable classes
- ✅ Refactor poorly designed code to follow best practices
- ✅ Implement interfaces using Protocol and ABC
- ✅ Design classes with single responsibility and loose coupling
